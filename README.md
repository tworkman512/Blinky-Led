# Blinky-Led
A bare bones Tessel 2 blinky led script

## This repo makes a few assumptions:
1. You have a Tessel 2 board
2. You have either the parts or have the Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit
3. You've already setup and provisioned your Tessel 2 and are ready to build cool projects!

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. npm install
4. In your terminal, enter the command t2 run led.js (Note: this assumes you have setup a breadboard with an LED and an 100Î© resistor.)

# Blinky-Led
A bare bones Tessel 2 blinky led script

## This repo makes a few assumptions:
1. You have a Tessel 2 board
2. You either have all the needed parts or have the Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit, which has it all!
3. You've already setup and provisioned your Tessel 2 and are ready to build cool projects!

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repo
2. cd to your project directory
3. npm install (Note: you need to tell Node to require tessel-io and johnny-five, otherwise things won't work.)
4. In your terminal, enter the command t2 run led.js 
(Note: this assumes you have setup a breadboard with an LED and an 100Î© resistor.)
